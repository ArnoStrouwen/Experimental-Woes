# Dr. Ir. Arno Strouwen

I am a freelance statistician specialized in experimental design for dynamic systems.
Often, researchers will perform experiments and only  talk to a statistician afterwards.
But statisticians are not only useful for data analysis.
Much time and effort can be saved by carefully planning an experiment.
Every measurement setup has its own unique details.
I help other researchers by constructing optimal experiments, custom made for their own measurement setup, goals and budgetary constraints.

Much of my expertise in experimental design, I developed during my FWO fellowship as a Ph.D. student at the KULeuven. 
There, I designed experiments to precisely characterize the respiration and fermentation of fruit and vegetables, leading to better storage solutions.

After my Ph.D., I joined the manufacturing and applied statistics department of the Janssen pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson for a postdoc.
I worked on designing accelerated stability studies to precisely predict the shelf life of vaccines and other drug products.
Some of my other responsibilities included designing high-throughput experiments to optimize the manufacturing conditions of chemical reactions,
Bayesian mixed effect modelling to determine the mechanical properties of powders,
and optimally blocking experiments when full randomization is not an option.

I then felt ready for a new challenge, starting my own consulting company, Strouwen Statistics.
My first client is JuliaHub,
where I work on improving the continuous integration and delivery of the documentation of the Scientific machine learning Project (SciML).
